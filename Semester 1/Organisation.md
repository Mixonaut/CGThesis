# Organisation
This file details a rough timeline of the work I completed in the first semester. This is split roughly in two parts: Topic selection and Proposal/Prototype Implementation. 
##  Topic Selection 08/09/25 - 23/10/25 

**Weeks 1-2  (08/09/25  -  18/09/25)**
 - I was still deciding on the topic in question, as I was unsure whether to pick a game or graphics oriented project.
 -  After a meeting and some research I decided to purse a project in computer graphics specifically, although I only had general ideas in mind.

**Weeks 3-5 (18/09/25 - 10/10/25)**

 - Independently researched and formulated some ideas for the project, more specifically on procedural model placement
 - My main idea at this point was a procedural generation of decoration given a template of a city. Decoration would include street lamps, bins and crowds.
 - Culminated with a meeting on 10/10/25, in which we discussed my initial ideas. 
 - Came to the conclusion that the main idea lacked a concise and clear way to evaluate it and wasn't relevant enough to the idea of computer science (it would include much more modelling). It was also far too large in scope. Leading to the next stage where I came up with more ideas.

**Weeks 5-7 (10/10/25 - 23/10/25)** 

 - Included weekly meetings in which we discussed my further ideas.
 - Ideas included, shaders, procedural modelling of assets for video games and others. 
 - Final idea finalised on meeting on the 23/10/25
 - Final idea decided to be a procedural generation of vegetation on top of 		    meshes.
 - Submitted Ethics Form soon after.
 
 ## Proposal/Prototype Implementation 23/10/25 - 20/11/25 
 - Worked on the proposal document during this time. 
 - Started with background research for about a week (23-10/25 - 02/11/25) to gather information before proposal could be fully started.
 - This information was used for most of the sections.
 - Worked on my prototype at the same time, using documentation and various tutorials on Unity to complete it by about 15/11/25
 - Project was submitted for final feedback for any glaring issues on the 19/11/2025 and fixed accordingly
 - Video (D2) made before submission on roughly the same day
 - Both submitted 20/11/25
